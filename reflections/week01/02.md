## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

- a Psuedo-Class defines a CSS style for an element with  the condition the element is in a <b> certain state</b>
as in being hovered over.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

- Specificity rules that if there is two or more CSS rules that apply to the same element, the rule with the higher <b>Specificity</b> will "win" and the properties and values of that CSS rule will be applied over the others. using it to your benefit might look like having your main content centered apart from one element that is nested inside the same container shifted off-center instead.


3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

- problems can occur because the only way to override an !Important rule is to include another !Important rule with a higher specificity which can make the CSS code confusing and make debugging more difficult.
