# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

-There is an enormous amount of concepts and knowledge, but what's going well is i'm having a lot of fun with learning it all.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
-coming up with concepts and ideas is far easier than trying to properly execute it in practice.
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?
