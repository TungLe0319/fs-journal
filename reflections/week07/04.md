# Sprint Retrospective

![replace_me](https://codeworks.blob.core.windows.net/public/assets/img/illustrations/placeholder.svg)

## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

 -  time boxing, user experience thought practices
 - anytime I got to a part that i felt stuck on for more than 10-15minutes I would take a breather, and start on another problem and move on from there, eventually winding my way back and having fresh eyes on the old problem and able to see my way through it

2. What went well this week?

- felt uncomfortable with the backend part of the Tower but after having reviewed my code as well as the inclass ones was able to feel better about tacking requests and returns from a mongodb server

3. What would you do differently?

- more planning rather than blind autopilot coding than i did, make more global classes and variables rather than retyping many of them over and over again in different components or just making multple components and not reusing them where i could've.
