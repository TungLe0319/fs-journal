## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
- strongly typed constants..., unique types that allow you to assign symbolic names to integral values
- Enums are value types, which means they contain their own value, canâ€™t inherit or be inherited from, and assignment copies the value of one enum to another. 

2. How can you modify an Enum?
- set the value of an enum member. By default, the first member of an enum takes the value of zero. If this value doesnâ€™t make sense for your enum, you can change it to one or some other number.

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

- IN class project we did hogwarts houses and used the harrypotter houses as enums and set character we made to their corresponding houses
