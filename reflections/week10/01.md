## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
-  Value Type, holds a data value within it's own memory  the variables of these data types directly contain values
- Reference Type, stores the address of where the value is , a pointer to another memory location that holds the data
- Pointer Type, pointer types do not inherit from object and no conversions exist between pointer types and object
 
2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
- bool,byte,chare,decimal.double,enum,float,int,long,sbyte,short, struct,uint,ulong,ushort
- there is MUCH more to keep track off but the reliability of being strict with having to use declare the types

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
- reference types get stored in memory through abstracting it into service or controller layers where they reference or point to the actualy data values (models/schemas) which be the Value types they reference their data from
