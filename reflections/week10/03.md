## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

- a whole row is the spread out /flattened out information/property types to a object  while a column i see is a single property type shared amongst multiple similar objects

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.
- CREATE TABLE
    IF NOT EXISTS characters(
        id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
        createdAt DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP COMMENT 'Time Created',
        updatedAt DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP COMMENT 'Last Update',
        creatorId VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       age INT NOT NULL,
       description VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
        FOREIGN KEY (creatorId) REFERENCES accounts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
   
    ) default charset utf8 COMMENT '';


3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```


- DELETE FROM will only delete one or  a specified amount 
- DROP TABLE will delete the entire table and all of it's information
