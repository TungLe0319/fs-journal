## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

- Promises are Akin to promises in real life, they are either kept when the time comes or rejected, promises are objects.
- Pending : initial State, before the promise succeeds or fails.
- Resolved: Completed Promise. |.then()|
- rejected: Failed Promise. |.catch()|

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

- we can attach callbacks to promises rather than passing them which when using in succession or "chaining "it makes code much cleaner and easier to read.

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?
 - .then() method is called after hte Promise is resolved or succeeds and then we can decide what to do with the revolved Promise. 
 - .catch() is for Promises that fail or rejected and we can give back a console log or error and be able to catch when and where it's taking place.
