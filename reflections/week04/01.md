> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

- when people try to write  javascript in a way where execution happens visually top to bottom. many layers and a pyramid shape  of })'s

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

- just means ' takes some time' or happens later in the future just not right away, 

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

- keep code shallow, use good descriptive naming conventions for functions names and function names for when exceptions happen which will give good references back to the function.
- Modularize, compartmentalize as much of a project as you can. make small models that each do things and russian doll them into other modules  that do a bigger thing. 
- Handle every single error, a popular method is having the first argument to the callback being reserves for an error.
- don't nest functions, split them up properly into their individual tasks  and place them at the top level of your program, utilize function hoisting , handle errors with the use of a linter ( standard).
