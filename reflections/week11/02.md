## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`
- A primary key is used to ensure data in the specific column is unique. A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between data in two tables.

2. What is an `Alias`?
- An alias is an alternate name for someone or something. It was used in .net. Data type aliasing allows us to use an alias of a data type instead of actual data type name.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:
 - "
 SELECT
d.*,
p.*
 FROM doctors d
 JOIN patients p ON p.id = doctor.patientId
 WHERE 
d.id = patient.doctorId
 "

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

```
