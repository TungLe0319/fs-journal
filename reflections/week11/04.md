## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

- a reflection for myself is i can't believe how much i've still enjoyed the struggles and problem solving  in this course, how friendly the people are and how patient the instructors and TA's have been. it's been such a journey and an honour to take this course and still be excited to learn more in this field..
