## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

- console.log() should be used when you want to know when  something is happening and what it is.
 - console.error() when you have an error happening in your code or received from an API  you can distinguish the source.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

- The Elements Tab you can test different styles and directly see the change being applied, also look into detail all the properties being applied to any or any specific element in the DOM

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

- possibly using breakpoints. where when used it will pause your code on the function that you set it so you can meticulously find which single source function needs to be debugged.
