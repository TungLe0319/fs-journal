## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

- the places where any of the variables are available for use. globally or locally usually.

2. What is Hoisting ? 

- Where Variables and function declarations are "hoisted" or moved to the top of their scope.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

- I would use let and Var when i am expecting their value to possible shift and change. and I would use let when i am only using the var within functions and not calling to them globally where i would use var like root variables and then i would last but not least use Const when the data/variable is going to stay static.
