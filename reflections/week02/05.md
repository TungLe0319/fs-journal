# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- staying up top on bootstrap and my html structering while learning javascript was nice to know for myself that i was able to retain alot of the learning of the previous week.


- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

- javascript is quite complex when trying to do logical things that make sense in my head but when trying to execute it i have to go very roundabout ways of getting the result.

- What are you struggling with?

- iterating over arrays and trying to load items from local storage has been difficult i am able to grab all the information i need but i can't seem to replace the array that i bring back.

- What would you count as a victory?

- had still a huge amount of fun doing all this despite the difficulty and minor frustrations. feels amazing once a problem you've been working on and think you'll never figure out and finally conquering it .
