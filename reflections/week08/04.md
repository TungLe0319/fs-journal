## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

-End-to-End Testing, Component Testing, and Unit Testing
2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
- End to End, provides coverage on the most important aspect of an application, what happens when users actually use your applications, validate all of the layers in your application

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

- Unit testing, due to the fact i feel i can do this while also flushing out an entire component and bug testing within that as a whole, maybe too much time spent on small bit of code testing rather than components when flushed out can be more efficient
