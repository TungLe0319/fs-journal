## Questions

1. What is Software Development Testing?
- testing the smallest unit of code, focusing on a single behavior
- usually a (public) method or a class or couple of classes together

2. What are the benefits of Testing in software development?
- peace of mind , it helps to eliminate worry, a well-tested module is a trustworthy thing that gives you stability within code, as well as one less thing to worry about when making changes to the system

- Confidence because testing forces you to experiment with various ways of solving the problem you've set out to fix, you usually focus on B line to the feature you wanted to implement but testing along the way allows for creative ideas and changes that can benefit you

- Efficiency , the first line of defense against bugs, in the best position to test apart from the QA team,
- Documentation, comments should only be written when it's not possible to make the code's intent obvious, standards (Arrange,Act,Assert) or (Given,When,Then) small lines of code roughly three, clear name that expresses the intent of the test,

- Better design, Amazing tool to use for improving the architecture of a system, identifying ideas not well thought out 
3. What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?

- Getting the Development Team on Board
- may have to convince management of the cost/time to run tests
- Not much compared to the benefits
