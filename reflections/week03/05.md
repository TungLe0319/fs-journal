# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

 - not feeling incredibly left behind with the content even after having lost a day. the MVC pattern feels overwhelming only being introduced to it now but i see the promise and benefit of getting use to it.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

- i only assumed for the most part the most files i'd have to juggle with were up to roughly 10-15 now i see with larger scaled projects i'll have to juggle a plethera more .

- What are you struggling with?

- catching on to not getting lost in my own code and naming conventions.


- What would you count as a victory?

- feeling the dots connecting with the MVC pattern and seeing how using intellisense is a god send. feeling the patterns coming together feels a great accomplishment.
